# Randomiiiiiiizer

## Generated for educational use (MA570).

This is a tool to help visualize randomess and probability by displaying data in bar charts.

## Special thanks

* ZingChart - for providing the lovely bar charts library
* Chance - for generating the random data set for the bar charts

### How to use

This tool is based off the game Keno.  I have preselected the game where you (as the player) generate (or pick) 10 unique numbers and the computer (i.e. the OLG) picks 20 unique numbers.  We want to see how many you get the same.

* Randomizer Computer - generates the 20 numbers for the computer
* Randomize Human - generates the 10 numbers for you
* Randomize Both - generates both (computer and player) of your numbers in one call
* Alert PC & Human - alert that shows the 2 sets of numbers
* Reload - reloads the graph with the computers 20 numbers

### Notes
Randomiiiiiiizer will continue to have updates and bug fixes.  Please check back for the latest version.
